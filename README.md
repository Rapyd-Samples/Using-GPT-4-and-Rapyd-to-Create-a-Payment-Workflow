# Using-GPT-4-and-Rapyd-to-Create-a-Payment-Workflow

In this tutorial, Iâ€™ll show you how to use GPT-4 to create a secure payment form and workflow using Rapyd's API.

## Features

* Creates a payment request with Rapyd API
* Simple form to enter payment details
* Securely signs API requests

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Flask
* Requests


## Configuration

Open the `app.py` file and replace `RAPYD_ACCESS_KEY` and `RAPYD_SECRET_KEY` with your actual Rapyd API keys.

`RAPYD_ACCESS_KEY = 'your-access-key-here'`

`RAPYD_SECRET_KEY = 'your-secret-key-here'`

## Running the App

Run the application:

`python app.py`

Now, the application will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Open this URL in your browser and you will see a form to enter payment details.

## Usage

1. Fill out the form with payment details.
2. Click "Submit" to create a payment request.
   
You should see the response from the Rapyd API on the screen.

## Security

This example uses HMAC-based authentication to securely sign API requests. Never expose your Rapyd API keys in client-side code.
